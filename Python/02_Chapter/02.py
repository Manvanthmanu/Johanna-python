# operators in python
## Operators - an operator is something which does some logical operation 

# Arithmetic operator ( calculations )
    # + , - , * , / , % , ** , 

# a = 10
# b = 20

# sum = a + b
# sub = a - b
# mul = a * b
# div = a / b
# rem = a % b 
# exp = a ** b

# print(sum)


# comparision operator ( true or false )
    # > , < , == , >= ,<= , != ,  

# a = 10
# b = 10

# greaterThen = a > b
# lesserThen = a < b
# eaqualTo = a == b
# greaterOrEqualTo = a >= b
# lesserOrEqualTo = a <= b
# notEqual = a != b

# print(greaterThen)




# Logical operator 
    # not , or  , and 



# a = 20
# b = 30

# c = a > b
# d = a < b


# print(c and d)
